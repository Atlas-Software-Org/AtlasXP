# ASNU-Kernel
Currently at version 0.0.8 ASNU-Kernel supports an ELF loader, built-in shell called nutshell, better PS2 keyboard driver, Syscalls (using int 0x80), and a VMM.

# Fixed configuration file
now configuring ASNU-Kernel is easier than last version, just run ./configure and voila ASNU-Kernel is ready to run
to run ASNU-Kernel use
```bash
make run-hdd
```
or
```bash
make run
```
