SuperBlock:

uint8_t SuperBlockSignature[5] --- "UFSSB"
uint32_t LBA_DataBegin --- Defined in the EBPB reserved uint32_t sections

uint32_t Clus_MOT
uint16_t FSVersion
uint32_t LBA_ReservedSuperBlockBackup0
uint32_t LBA_ReservedSuperBlockBackup1
uint32_t LBA_SuperBlockCacheBackup2 ---- Use this to play around with the SuperBlock, and before shutdown or reboot or change of powerstate you can write the SuperBlock
----- optional and this feature can be ignored
uint16_t EndOfSuperBlockSignature --- 0xFFEF

MOT (Master object table):

uint32_t TotalObjects
MotObject* Objects;
uint16_t EndOfMOTSignature --- 0xFF09

MotObject:

uint8_t ObjectType
uint64_t UnixCreateTime
uint8_t ObjectPermissions
uint16_t OwnerID
uint16_t GroupID
uint8_t ObjectFlags
uint64_t ObjectDataSize
uint32_t ObjectClusterStart

uint8_t ObjectNameLength
MotObject ParentObject
char* ObjectName
uint16_t EndOfObjectSignature --- 0xFF0F


------ every single entry is aligned to a cluster (a cluster is two 512 sectors, or one kilobyte)
